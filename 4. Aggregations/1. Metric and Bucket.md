# Write and execute metric and bucket aggregations

## Metric aggregations
[Cardinality aggregation.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.2/search-aggregations-metrics-cardinality-aggregation.html)

If we indexed a 'colour' field for a bunch of products, we could answer the question "How many unique colours are there in our catalog?".
Example:
```json
GET products/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "colours": {
      "cardinality": {
        "field": "colour.keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


[Terms aggregation.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.2/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html)

For the same case as above, how many products of each colour do we have? 
```json
GET products/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "colours": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "colour.keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
